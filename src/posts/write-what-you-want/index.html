                One of my favorite moments in Almost Famous is when all our
                characters have survived what was thought to be a plane crash.
                The crew deplanes after landing safely and walks down a corridor
                at a small airport collecting themselves. William vomits in a
                trash can. After this, Russell tells William, “Write what you
                want.”

                Beneath this scene is an amazing bit of score assembled from a
                live version of Neil Young’s Cortez the Killer from his Bridge
                School Benefit XIII. After many years of listening to audio I
                ripped directly from the film, I’ve gone to the source and
                re-edited it to line up with how it was presented in the film.
                Enjoy this high quality copy. 😎
