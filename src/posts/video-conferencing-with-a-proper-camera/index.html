      <h2>Video Conferencing with a Proper Camera</h2>
      <p class="meta">November 2018</p>

      <p>Being a full-time remote employee at Stack Overflow means most of my daily interactions are spent via video conference. This is usually in <span class="strike">Google Hangouts</span> Meet or Zoom. These interactions range from giving and receiving design critique, doing general status updates, or coordinating efforts across our teams.</p>
      <p>Hereâ€™s the thing about webcams. Every webcam is a huge piece of shit that optimizes for the wrong thing. They all suck in low light. Theyâ€™re all super wide angle that captures way more of your background thanâ€¦ you. Webcams that are built into your display can be even worse than standalone models.</p>

      <h3>Comparisons</h3>
      <p>Letâ€™s have a look at the camera built into my Apple Thunderbolt Display. This image is slightly blurry, and is an incredibly wide image. At a distance from my desk thatâ€™s appropriate for typing, I take up very little of the actual frame. Too much of my surrounding office is visible. When I look into the black reflection of my display, I donâ€™t see this scene.</p>

      <p>I actually see something that looks like this trash:</p>
      <div class="caption">
        <img src="media/webcam.jpg" width="540" loading="lazy">
        Built in webcam.
      </div>

      <p>This image is how my eye perceives the world, and how I actually look when looking in a mirror, or the reflection in my display. If you see me in real life, this is how I look:</p>

        <img src="media/camera.jpg" width="808" loading="lazy">
        A proper camera.
      </div>

      <h3>Equipment</h3>
      <p>To actually achieve this look, youâ€™ll need a camera with a lens of about 30mm to 50mm in focal length. I run a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Mirrorless-Camera-Interchangeable-Digital/dp/B007GK50X4">Sony a6300</a> with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C3SCKI6/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=aaronshekey-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01C3SCKI6&linkId=2438561c9b6fcba6ead0151176174992">Sigma 30mm lens</a> set to 1.4f. This allows for the soft focus background and amazing low light performance. I still look like me even in the very rare evening or early morning meeting.</p>
      <p>I run my camera via <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DRMV10Q/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=aaronshekey-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00DRMV10Q&linkId=24f0afa15ade86a42e359cbb8bac1134">HDMI</a> to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0748QYPX9/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=aaronshekey-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0748QYPX9&linkId=2af4d454a1c9e5c0eeae798b1085f637">Elgato Cam Link</a>. This device rules. It allows for true plug and play <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DRMV10Q/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=aaronshekey-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00DRMV10Q&linkId=24f0afa15ade86a42e359cbb8bac1134">HDMI</a> in via USB. Donâ€™t mess with the Black Magic or other devices out there. They suck compared to this stick.</p>

      <h3>Gotchas</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Bandwidth is always a consideration. No matter how great your camera image is, itâ€™ll still get compressed over the internet. I have gigabit service, so this is mitigated in some ways.</li>
        <li>Youâ€™ll need to ditch the batteries for constant power. I bought this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083EQS3I/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=aaronshekey-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0083EQS3I&linkId=3df1e34a43daa570c43ac222d1ca7027">adapter</a> to trick my Sony into being plugged into the wall.</li>
        <li>Youâ€™ll have to turn your camera on and off.</li>
        <li>People will lose their minds the first time you conference with them and you look this great.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Takeaway</h3>
      <p>If youâ€™re looking to upgrade your webcam, the biggest bang for your buck will be spent on a lens thatâ€™s around 30mm to 50mm and allows for a wide open aperture. Donâ€™t mess around with wide angle stuff. Find an old dumpy camera and put a nice lens on it. Throw that into <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0748QYPX9/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=aaronshekey-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0748QYPX9&linkId=2af4d454a1c9e5c0eeae798b1085f637">Elgatoâ€™s Cam Link</a> and youâ€™re ready to party. ðŸŽ¥</p>
