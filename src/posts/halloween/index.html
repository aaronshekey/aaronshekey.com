      <h2>Why Halloween?</h2>
      <p class="meta">Halloween, 2024</p>
      <p>
        A holiday that celebrates imagination? A day to acknowledge
        things we fear? A holiday where we can choose to respect or mock
        the macabre? Incredible.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the community! What other holiday are you expected to meet
        your neighbors and explore the neighborhood‚Äîwhatever that looks
        like to you? A whole night just for kids that isn‚Äôt strictly
        christian?
      </p>
      <p>
        And you can lean into the craft of it all. Carving pumpkins,
        decorating your home, building your costume. You can eat candy
        without guilt. You can trade what you got for what you want. Or
        not at all.
      </p>

        It brings me so much joy to see all the trick-or-treaters over
        the years. It makes me happy to see the youngest families. I
        remember the kids that have outgrown it.
      </p>

        In Minnesota, you never know what kind of weather you‚Äôll get.
        There‚Äôs true costume creativity while trying to stay warm.

        Last year we gave away 126 full-size candy bars. Just shy of our
        record 133 in 2018. I teared up when a 7 year old shouted ‚ÄúWOW.
        I HOPE YOU‚ÄôRE HAVING THE BEST HALLOWEEN‚Äù and I could reply
        truthfully, ‚ÄúI AM! HAVE FUN OUT THERE!‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>I hope y‚Äôall have a great Halloween. I always do! ü¶á</p>

        We decided to be full-sized candy people and to be kind to our
        inner children.
