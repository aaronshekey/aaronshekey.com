            <h2>Who is Aaron Shekey?</h2>
                <p>A little wonder goes a long, long way.</p>
                <p>
                    While I mostly get paid to be a product designer, I’m also a
                    musician, a songwriter, producer, carpenter, a writer, an
                    audio engineer, a front-end developer, an app developer, an
                    investor, a director, an animator, speaker, a homeowner, a
                    remodeler, and just a generally curious fella. I believe in
                    following passions and exploring.

                    Beyond the things I do, I love films and television. I like
                    watching things critically and enjoying the craft—figuring
                    out how my favorite things got made, and where my least
                    favorite things went wrong. With MoviePass I had one of the
                    best summers of my life.

                    I love to swim. I could wade around all day. I also
                    absolutely love hot tubs. What’s better than a night at the
                    Hewing with your friends? Recently, I’ve really gotten into
                    float tanks, though 2020 put a pause on that.

                    My home is Minneapolis, MN. I love to travel. I adore New
                    Orleans. I’ve failed to visit Japan on two separate
                    occasions. I’d love to see everywhere twice.
