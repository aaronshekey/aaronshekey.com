            <h2>Who is Aaron Shekey?</h2>
                <p>Are you having fun? I’m having fun.</p>
                <p>
                    While I mostly get paid to be a product designer, I’m also a
                    musician, a songwriter, producer, carpenter, a writer, an
                    audio engineer, a front-end developer, an app developer, an
                    investor, a director, an animator, speaker, a homeowner, a
                    remodeler, and just a generally curious fella. I believe in
                    following passions and exploring.
                </p>
                <p>As a product designer, I’ve always loved to sit as closely to the code as possible. Most features that I design, I try to have a hand in building. I find it speeds up the feedback loops, allowing engineers to focus on the hardest problems. Prototyping is great. Shipping is even better. I’ve pushed hard on my teams to understand that we don’t actually ship Figmas. This has led me to build a few design systems at <em>massive</em> scale, most notably <a href="/work/stackoverflow">Stack Overflow</a>, duplicating my efforts across various organizations over the years.</p>
                <p>
                    Beyond the things I do, I love films and television. I like
                    watching things critically and enjoying the craft—figuring
                    out how my favorite things got made, and where my least
                    favorite things went wrong. With MoviePass I had one of the
                    best summers of my life.
                </p>
                <p>In 2025, I became a dad. Most of the cliches they offer are true, and I’m having an absolute blast. It feels so good to be present, and to find the joy and discovery in even the smallest moments.</p>
                <p>
                    I love to swim. I could wade around all day. I also
                    absolutely love hot tubs. I finally installed one at my house in 2021. I love to renovate homes, and have had the pleasure of doing it 3 or so times. There are rough homes that need a little love. I enjoy bringing them back to life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My home is Minneapolis, MN. I serve on my <a href="https://saenaminneapolis.org">neighborhood’s board</a> as its president. There I’ve helped build our community through things like festivals, plant giveaways, and smaller projects like sled libraries. I love to travel. I adore New Orleans. It would be so nice to get to Japan someday. I’d love to see everywhere twice.
                </p>
                <p>I think a little wonder goes a long, long way.</p>
