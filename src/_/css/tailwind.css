  Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration

  This file is processed by the Tailwind CLI during the build process.
  The Tailwind classes are automatically detected from your HTML files
  and only the used classes are included in the final output.

  To customize Tailwind's default configuration, you can:
  1. Add custom CSS properties and classes below
  2. Use CSS @layer directives to organize your styles
  3. Override Tailwind's default theme values

  Example custom utilities:
  @layer utilities {
    .text-balance {
      text-wrap: balance;
    }
  }

/* Custom styles can go here */
