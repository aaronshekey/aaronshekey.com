            <p>
                In 2022, I joined Boox, a sustainability startup with the
                mission of eliminating single-use packaging. I was their
                director of user experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                Boox’s first product is a reusable shipping box that, unlike
                cardboard, can be reused around 12 times. Besides reusability,
                Booxes are stronger, don’t require tape to assemble, fold flat,
                and can be created in a far wider selection of colors with far
                more flexible branding.

            <p>
                When tasked with redesigning
                <a href="https://boox.eco">Boox’s website</a>, we wanted the
                site to do a few things:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Explain the overall concept to consumers and box purchasers
                    alike.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Show that Boox is able to scale with your business,
                    satisfying millions of shipments while integrating as a
                    turnkey solution.
                </li>
                <li>Legitimize Boox’s branding.</li>
                <li>Deploy on Shopify to offer some e-commerce features.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Explain the concept</h4>

            <p>
                Our pitch was simple, allow for millions of sustainable
                shipments with zero waste. We chose to highlight 5 verticals in
                the hero section using 3D animation. We’d show generalized
                categories—apparel, beauty, grocery, footwear, and beverages.
                With each vertical, we’d show a different box size with unique
                branding to show flexibility. To make things a bit more
                abstract, we candy coated each of the various items inside and
                outside the box.
            </p>

            <p>
                With my rough art direction, we hired Jack Harvatt from
                <a href="https://harvatt.house">harvatt.house</a> to create the
                animation. We couldn’t be more pleased with the result. Once we
                had our hero asset, we exported a single asset that’d work
                throughout all the various responsive device sizes. This way, we
                could do all the necessary cropping within the browser.
            </p>

            <h4>Boox can scale</h4>

            <p>
                It was important to our founders that when a representative from
                a company visits this site, they’d understand that Boox was
                ready to scale to their business. We wanted the site to have a
                single, ever-present call to action button that says “Switch to
                Boox”. We included our most visible current clients in as many
                verticals as we could. We included as many real-world examples
                of our current clientele, and teased launches in countries other
                than the United States, and outside North America.
            </p>

            <h4>Legitimize</h4>

            <p>
                Boox has been incredibly fortunate to have a huge wealth of
                user-generated content to feature on our site. We featured a
                couple organic unboxing videos from Instagram and animated a
                real collection of comments below one of the more engaging
                clips.
            </p>

            <p>
                Beyond user generated content, Boox has collected a few great
                bits of traditional online and print media. Of course we
                included the obligatory “As seen in…” section. When building a
                brand website in 2023, it’s illegal not to.
            </p>

            <h4>Deploy via Shopify</h4>

            <p>
                This was my first foray into building a Shopify theme to host
                this largely static website. We wanted to keep our
                infrastructure on Shopify since we've got a few SKUs on the
                backend for “purchasing” samples. At the smaller end of our
                market, we also have self-service purchasing for limited
                quantaties of Booxes.
            </p>

            <p>
                With this revamp, we now had a site that satisfied our
                stakeholders and properly explained the entire endeavor. It also
                generates leads for our sales folks and legitimizes our brand.
            </p>

            <h3 id="scan-experience">Scan experience</h3>

            <p>
                When a product is delivered in a Boox, there is a graphic on the
                inside of the box that says “don’t throw me away, scan me
                instead!”. In that moment, a user scans the QR code and is taken
                to our “scan experience.” This scan experience needs to do a few
                things:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Explain how to the user how to return our box</li>
                <li>Explain the benefits of this box</li>
                <li>Allow for the brand engagement and stickiness</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Returning the box</h4>

            <p>
                Look, we really want this box back, ok? So much so that in in
                its original iteration, we included prepaid shipping labels in
                our boxes. You’d flatten the box, apply the sticker, and drop it
                off.
            </p>

            <p>
                Eventually, we realized our Booxes were an opportunity for more
                than simple return. We could introduce a concept we call
                re-commerce with our boxes, allowing users to declutter their
                home of gently-used clothing and other household items. Brands
                could offer their customers recycling of their own brand’s
                packaging—think pump bottles, lipstick tubes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our scan experience would need illustrate what could be returned
                and guide users to various drop-off points or provide postage.
            </p>

            <p>
                We ultimately built a wizard that allows users to configure
                their return. When tapping each option, the onscreen Boox would
                reflect what they’d chosen.
            </p>

            <figure
                class="w-screen relative left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 max-w-none"
            >
                <img
                    src="media/scan-return.png"
                    width="360"
                    loading="lazy"
                    class="mx-auto rounded-lg"
                />
                <figcaption class="text-center">
                    Once they’ve told us what they're returning, we show where
                    and how.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Explain the benefits</h4>

            <p>
                There are a million ways to show the benefits of our Boox. In
                our latest iteration, we chose to compare to cardboard boxes and
                settled on the idea that by shipping in cardboard, you’re
                sending your customers trash. This became a powerful visual, and
                one that resonates with a majority of our users. We’ve all had
                an entryway filled with cardboard boxes that won't be reused.
            </p>

            <h4>Allow for brand engagement and stickiness</h4>

            <p>
                We also incentivize consumers to return their box by offering
                rewards they can use at the retailer that sent them the Boox. In
                the future, we may be able to scale this beyond that single
                retailer. Purchasing from a company that ships in a Boox could
                get you access to rewards from other companies in their
                portfolio.
            </p>

            <p>
                If the client was large enough, we’d allow full customization of
                the scan experience. We built our app to enable full
                white-labeling for various brands. We allowed for switching box
                colors, graphics, scan colors, fonts, spacing—everything you’d
                expect from a custom experience.
            </p>

            <h3 id="theming">Theming</h3>

            <p>
                To power a white labeled experience, we generated a lean design
                system to power the scan experience.
            </p>

            <h4>Storing color as HSL in CSS variables</h4>

            <p>
                To build our system, we isolated a few colors in our scan
                experience. We’d have colors for a brand, text, success, danger,
                and warnings. Each of these colors would have variations of
                lightness with 100 being the lightest, and 900 being the
                darkest.
            </p>

            <p>
                In our configuration, we’d provide the middle value of
                <code>500</code> as individual <code>h</code>, <code>s</code>,
                and <code>l</code> values. Then, we’d operate on those
                individual values to re-assemble them as color gradations using
                CSS <code>calc</code> functions.

            <h4>Find a color curve</h4>

            <p>
                To find <em>how</em> we’d operate on our colors, I built a small
                interface to fine-tune those curves to reliably accept any
                arbitrary brand color and spit out a proper color space. These
                are far from linear, and I wanted to tweak them
                <em>visually</em>, without relying on perfect math. This demo
                also includes an alert component that uses the lightest and
                darkest colors on a scale to determine if they’re usable.
            </p>

            <p>
                This interface includes an arbitrary color picker to test the
                various scenarios. These are the production color curves chosen
                by myself and the Boox crew. There’s enough variation between
                each color stop, and it doesn’t fall apart in the edge cases.
            </p>

            <p>
                You’ll notice there’s quite a jump between the 300 and 400 step,
                mathmatically. Visually, it’s equidistant. Trust your eyes.
            </p>

            <p>
                We can do this with each of our hues, creating entire color
                palettes on the fly, while only tweaking a few CSS variables
            </p>

            <h4>Apply within Tailwind</h4>

            <p>
                All of Boox’s experiences are built using Tailwind. Thankfully,
                Tailwind allows for inclusion of arbitrary classes within its
                <code>@layer</code> utilities directive. We can assemble each of
                the colors we created using their nomenclature like so:
            </p>

            <!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
            <pre class="text-sm">
:root {
  /* Store our brand color as h, s, and l values */
  --theme-brand-h: 201;
  --theme-brand-s: 70%;
  --theme-brand-l: 40%;

  /* Re-assemble the brand color as a single variable */
  --theme-brand-500: hsl(
    var(--theme-brand-h),
    var(--theme-brand-s),
    var(--theme-brand-l)
  );
}

@layer utilities {
  .bg-brand-500 {
    background-color: var(--theme-brand-500);
  }

  .text-brand-500 {
    color: var(--theme-brand-500);
  }
}
</pre
            >
            <!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

            <p>
                This approach allowed us to use Tailwind-like tooling while
                being able to change the colors on the fly without compilation.
                Because a majority of our aesthetics were stored as CSS
                variables, we’d be able to build brand-specific experiences in
                the browser with our clients. And like Tailwind, these classes
                only get included in the bundle if they’re used. Sick!
            </p>

            <h4>Components</h4>

            <p>
                Then, we can assemble each of these colors as components as
                needed. In the case of Boox, we built a small collection of form
                elements—buttons, inputs, checkboxes, etc.
            </p>

            <figure
                class="w-screen relative left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 max-w-none p-4 bg-white"

                />
                <figcaption class="text-center">

            <h3 id="scan-studio">Scan studio</h3>

            <p>
                Ultimately, a majority of our theming was built in-browser using
                CSS variables. This allowed us to easily build a theming studio,
                enabling our sales folks and clients to experiment with how
                their scan experience would look.
            </p>

            <p>
                This tightened up feedback loops, reducing the number of
                back-and-forth emails. If the scan experience could do it, the
                client could customize it.
            </p>

            <figure
                class="w-screen relative left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 max-w-none"
            >
                <img
                    src="media/scan-studio.png"
                    width="1584"
                    loading="lazy"
                    class="mx-auto"
                />
                <figcaption class="text-center">The scan studio</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                My year at Boox led to a far more cohesive experience across
                their website and scan experiences. I worked closely with Matt
                Semmelhack, Bob Walton, and Paige Russell to collaborate on
                branding, copy, and overall direction. It was an absolute
                pleasure to design and build with them in this space.
