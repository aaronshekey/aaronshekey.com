                I had the opportunity to work full-time as a remote Product
                Designer at GitHub from March 2015 to October 2016. This is a
                collection of the work that I was able to help ship during my
                time as a Hubber™.

            <h3 id="markdown-toolbar">Markdown toolbar</h3>

            <p>
                In early conversations with GitHub, I’d shared my desire to help
                simplify some of their core experiences. Increasingly, GitHub is
                used by non-programmers and programmers alike. Issue triage and
                project management are often equally as important as the code
                itself, especially as an organization grows.
            </p>

            <p>
                All of the comment fields throughout GitHub support
                <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/"
                    >GitHub-flavored Markdown</a
                >. Markdown is a syntax that allows folks to make richer
                comments—adding things like links, lists, and images.
                Unfortunately, a great wealth of useful features were hidden
                behind this syntax. This seemed like a decent opportunity to add
                a lightweight toolbar to surface some of these. Prior to
                joining, we only had a link to a help document explaining the
                syntax.
            </p>

            <h4>Exploration</h4>

            <p>
                I first considered revamping the existing “Write” and “Preview”
                pane. The comment area is plain text in the “Write” tab, but
                when switching over to "Preview", it shows the final rendered
                output. I was hoping to swap these experiences. Instead of
                frequently switching to the “Preview” tab, I wanted to build an
                editor that would render Markdown on the fly. I would call these
                tabs “Visual” and “Markdown”. Our visual editor would render
                Markdown on the fly, allowing full use of the toolbar for
                formatting text. If this wasn’t desired, users could always flip
                tabs to see their raw Markdown. We’d remember that preference
                and allow for folks to ignore the Visual editor entirely. This
                style of editing was popularized by Wordpress.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <figure

                    alt="Markdown"

                    loading="lazy"
                    class="mx-auto"
                />
            </figure>

            <p>
                This being the very first issue I’d posted to
                <span class="highlight">github/github</span>, it was wisely
                suggested that I scale back the scope of modifying our site-wide
                comment box. Fair enough!
            </p>

            <figure
                class="w-screen relative left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 max-w-none"
            >
                <img
                    src="media/markdown-inline.png"
                    alt="Half"
                    width="760"
                    loading="lazy"
                    class="mx-auto"
                />
            </figure>

            <p>
                I then wanted to try to add light styling to the “Write” tab.
                This could allow for less toggling between the “Write” and
                “Preview” mode. Italics, for example, could be rendered inline
                while still showing the Markdown syntax. This is a popular
                pattern and turns up in lots of Markdown-based editors like
                <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a>.
            </p>

            <h4>Final approach</h4>

            <p>
                Ultimately, we ended up building a single toolbar for our GitHub
                Flavored Markdown without modifying either of the tabs. Instead
                of hiding Markdown functionality behind a help link, we put our
                powerful, but less-used features up front in a toolbar. Task
                lists, for example, are a really powerful project management
                tool that very few users knew about. The toolbar shows powerful
                features while making it easier for beginners to use GitHub.
                Rad!
            </p>

            <figure
                class="w-screen relative left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 max-w-none"
            >
                <img
                    src="media/markdown-final.png"
                    alt="Toolbar"
                    width="626"
                    loading="lazy"
                    class="mx-auto"
                />
            </figure>

            <p>
                While iterating, we stripped the button treatment on the
                toolbar. Since we didn’t want this feature to feel intrusive,
                this made things a lot lighter. We also ended up grouping
                functions by similar tasks. Text manipulations, links and media,
                lists, and less-used GitHub-flavored Markdown features are all
                properly grouped.
            </p>

            <figure

                    loading="lazy"
                    class="mx-auto"
                />
            </figure>

            <p>
                The heavy lifting on this feature was done by
                <a href="http://github.com/skalnik">@skalnik</a> and
                <a href="http://github.com/probablycorey">@probablycorey</a>. I
                drew pretty pictures and provided the UI work, and helped build
                proof of concept prototypes. Have a look at the

            <h3 id="tasklists">Re-orderable task lists</h3>

            <p>
                After our markdown toolbar shipped, many users would soon
                discover our task list feature.
            </p>

            <figure
                class="w-screen relative left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 max-w-none"
            >
                <img
                    src="media/tasklist.png"
                    alt="Tasklist"
                    width="660"
                    loading="lazy"
                    class="mx-auto"
                />
            </figure>

            <p>
                Tasklists are interactive lists that allow users to add tasks
                that can be checked off as they’re completed. They’re often used
                to describe the scope of the work left to do in a particular
                issue or pull request. They’re also used in meta issues, that
                act as a way to track the status of other issues or pull
                requests. Whenever issues or pull requests are displayed in a
                list, we expose the number of completed tasks in the issue body
                as a progress bar.
            </p>

            <figure
                class="w-screen relative left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 max-w-none"
            >
                <img
                    src="media/tasklist-progress.png"

                    class="mx-auto"
                />
            </figure>

            <p>
                Since users were now using task lists more frequently, we
                received lots of requests for the ability to re-arrange these
                items without having to edit the original comment.
            </p>

            <h4>Exploration</h4>

            <p>
                Early in the exploration of this feature, we discovered that
                since the task lists were already indented, we could use this
                empty space to show a drag affordance on hover. After a quick
                number of iterations, we landed on a simple three-bar’d icon
                approach.
            </p>

            <figure
                class="w-screen relative left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 max-w-none"

                    class="mx-auto"
                />
            </figure>

            <h4>Final approach</h4>
            <p>
                On highlight, we’ll show the grabber, but we’ll only change the
                cursor when the mouse is to the left of the checkbox so as not
                to interfere with text selection and checking the box. We’ll
                highlight the entire row and give it structure, so it’s more
                obvious what you’re about to drag.

            <h3 id="file-uploads">File uploads</h3>
            <p>
                Adding files to a repository on GitHub can be difficult. GitHub
                has great workflows for adding and editing single files, even
                allowing users to create pull requests from these edits. It’s a
                powerful way of collaborating on GitHub without having to leave
                your browser. However, there was no simple way of dragging and
                dropping files into a repository.
            </p>

            <figure
                class="w-screen relative left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 max-w-none"

            <p>
                This is the blank slate that most users see when they first
                create repository. We offer instructions for interacting with
                your repository via command line, but for many users, a user
                interface will always be more approachable and accessible. We
                should make adding files as easy as editing them.
            </p>
            <h4>Exploration</h4>

            <p>
                Since we’re adding files to a repository, my first explorations
                started with dragging and dropping files onto the file tree. I
                thought we could be clever and use the file tree’s background
                itself as both the drop target and the progress bar. In
                practice, this was a bit frustrating to use since the file tree
                didn’t have a fixed size. If a repository only had a single file
                in it, we would have a a much smaller drop target. This was easy
                to miss, and hard to discover, especially for a feature that
                should be optimized for empty or nearly-empty repositories.

            <h4>Final approach</h4>
            <p>
                The next approach moved the drop target to the full browser
                window. This allows users to more easily drop their files
                anywhere in the code view regardless of the size of their
                repository.
            </p>

            <figure
                class="w-screen relative left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 max-w-none"

                <img

                    loading="lazy"

            </figure>

            <p>
                While this was certainly better for users familiar with dragging
                and dropping, it wasn’t very discoverable or accessible.
            </p>
            <p>
                This led the team to add an explicit
                <span class="highlight">upload</span> button that would present
                an entirely new view with both a drop target and file chooser.
            </p>

                    class="mx-auto"
                />
            </figure>

            <p>
                In addition to a progress bar, we now had a consistent place for
                error messages and other edge cases. We could also allow users
                to stage their files and delete any errant uploads before
                showing them the familiar git workflows of committing directly
                to the branch or opening a pull request.
            </p>

            <p>
                Simply adding an upload button to our code view revealed a bit
                of design debt. We were quickly running out of space to add
                these buttons, and our design was suffering as a result. A small
                side-project revealed a couple optimizations.

                    We could group all of the file-related actions and be more
                    explicit with button copy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We could hide some of the unnecessary cloning options within

                <li>
                    We could actually say “clone” within the interface. We
                    hadn’t done that for a couple iterations and users found it
                    confusing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We could free up some space in the interface for additional
                    future features.

            <h3 id="protected-branches">Protected branches</h3>

            <p>
                Since a lot of GitHub’s userbase has started to become part of
                larger teams, we began looking seriously at features that
                allowed for more granular permissions where possible. Too often
                in organizations large and small, a collaborator might
                accidentally commit to the wrong branch,
                <span class="highlight">master</span>, for example. In
                worst-case scenarios, this could result in lost work via force
                push.
            </p>

            <p>
                Protected Branches allow for repository administrators to block
                committing to certain branches. This required adding a settings
                page that allowed for protected branch management.
            </p>

            <figure
                class="w-screen relative left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 max-w-none"
            >
                <img
                    src="media/protected-branches.png"
                    alt="Branch selection"
                    width="980"
                    loading="lazy"
                    class="mx-auto"
                />
            </figure>

            <p>
                In addition to blocking pushing directly to the protected
                branch, administrators can require status checks. These statuses
                are bots that can check for all sorts of things—code quality and
                linting, integration tests, regressions, etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                When these status checks fail, you can disable merging to the
                protected branch.
            </p>

            <figure
                class="w-screen relative left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 max-w-none"
            >
                <img
                    src="media/protected-branches-status.png"
                    alt="Status"

                    class="mx-auto"
                />
            </figure>

            <p>
                Since both our settings page user interface language and our
                merge area were well established, most of the design work for
                protected branches was focused on writing clear copy that was
                balanced and discoverable. This copy writing extended to each
                edge case—a rogue status test, for example.

            <p>
                Protected branches was one of the first features I worked on at
                GitHub. It was built by a ton of people,
                <a href="https://github.com/aroben">@aroben</a>,
                <a href="https://github.com/rsanheim">@rsanheim</a>, and
                <a href="https://github.com/nakajima">@nakajima</a> to name a

            <h3 id="saved-replies">Saved replies</h3>

            <p>
                When a large number of GitHub power users started to talk about
                their desire for re-usable snippets of text throughout GitHub,
                we thought this might be an opportunity for a new feature. Saved
                replies allow you to create any number of canned responses.
                These could aid in better responses to bug reports or issue
                triage, for example. Or perhaps you’re just sick of responding
                to that <em>same</em> feature request or bug.
            </p>

            <p>
                Like any project at GitHub, there are a lot of questions that
                need to be answered, even for what seems to be a simple feature.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Who owns saved replies?</li>
                <li>Do they belong to the repo?</li>
                <li>Do they belong to the user?</li>
                <li>Maybe they should be organization-wide.</li>
                <li>How will they get saved?</li>
                <li>
                    Should we just put a Markdown file in the repo directory
                    like we did with Issue and Pull Request templates?
                </li>
                <li>Maybe these should be saved to the database.</li>
                <li>Where do users add their saved replies?</li>
                <li>Where do users manage saved replies?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                I’m sure you get the idea. Ultimately, I argued users would get
                the most utility out of their saved replies being stored in the
                database at the user level. This way, we could easily test their
                usage and saved replies would follow users around to any
                repository, regardless of ownership. Managing your saved replies
                would show up in your user settings.
            </p>

            <p>
                Like Protected Branches, much of this design system already
                existed, making short work of adding the settings page.
            </p>

            <figure
                class="w-screen relative left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 max-w-none"

                    class="mx-auto"
                />
            </figure>

            <p>
                Since we’d added the Markdown toolbar to all our comment areas,
                it made sense to access saved replies as another GitHub-specific
                button.
            </p>

            <figure
                class="w-screen relative left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 max-w-none"
            >

                    width="731"
                    loading="lazy"
                    class="mx-auto"
                />
            </figure>

            <p>
                This posed a problem for first-time users of the feature. I
                crafted a blank slate that helped explain what the feature was
                and offered folks a way to create their first saved reply. This
                brought the user to their settings page where further
                information was provided should they need it.

                GitHub.com and every other GitHub property (Atom, GitHub
                Desktop, GitHub Universe, etc.) each use an icon library called

            <h4>Why redesign Octicons?</h4>
            <p>
                Prior to <span class="highlight">3.0</span>, Octicons were
                pretty chunky, especially when paired with system fonts.
                Different stroke weights appeared throughout the set. Corner
                radii were inconsistent. Nested corners were the same radius as
                their parents, leaving things feeling unnatural. Some icons
                suffered from legibility issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years the icon set had grown to include icons that were
                rarely used and possibly made sense with another metaphor
                entirely. This was an opportunity to pare down the collection.
                We could also explore making some of their visuals a bit more
                harmonious. We lost a bit of consistency over the years. It was
                time to try to get some back.

            <h4>Exploration</h4>
            <p>
                In early style explorations, it became obvious that there wasn’t
                a ton we were going to be able to change within the core Git
                icons. Thinning them to 1px left them fragile, unreadable. Since
                we’ve built a brand around these metaphors, changing them wildly
                was out of the question. These icons would have to stay put.
            </p>

            <p>
                Previous efforts had normalized all strokes to 2px based on
                these icons. This made all the icons really thick, leaving
                little room for detail on inner shapes.
            </p>

            </figure>

            <h4>Final stylings</h4>
            <p>
                These explorations led to a loose rule of 1px outer strokes,
                supported by a 2px inner stroke. Some of these strokes would
                have to be fussed over, optically, to keep things from appearing
                too razor-thin.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were some exceptions to this rule. File-types, for
                example, were really muddied by 2px inner strokes.
            </p>

            <figure
                class="w-screen relative left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 max-w-none"
            >

                    src="media/octicons-file-icons.png"
                    alt="File icons"

                    loading="lazy"
                    class="mx-auto"
                />

            </figure>

            <p>
                We also standardized on 1px corner radii to soften the overall
                appearance of the iconset. We were careful to never double those
                corners on the inside, leaving the edges hard. The calendar icon
                shows these rules well.
            </p>

            <h4>Context vs. Consistency</h4>
            <p>
                When building icon sets, it’s easy to fall into the trap of
                working on them all within a single canvas. This can be a form
                of tunnel vision. It certainly means a more harmonious set, but
                it can easily create a worse experience when they’re viewed in
                context of a large app like GitHub. Our folder icons, for
                example, needed to be filled so users could more easily discern
                between files and folders, even though this means the overall
                icon set is less harmonious when each icon is viewed
                side-by-side.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, the sizing of certain icons needed to be revisited
                once they were shown in context. Strokes, baselines, and overall
                metaphors needed to be considered in this context as well.
            </p>

            <h4>Practical Changes</h4>
            <p>
                Taking a fresh look at our icon set allowed us the opportunity
                to revisit a couple metaphors used throughout GitHub. We were
                able to swap our global notifications icon from an inbox icon
                (aka “Robot Bikini Top”) to the more common bell shape. We also
                embraced a redrawn gear, shying away from using our ‘tools’ icon
                for settings and the like.
            </p>

            <h3 id="code-review">Code review</h3>

            <p>
                By far the largest project I worked on at GitHub was code
                review. Prior to this feature, code review was an informal
                process that happened in pull requests. Say you wanted to make
                some changes to your app’s code. You’d make your changes in a
                new branch, and then create a pull request to merge those
                changes into <span class="highlight">master</span>. Prior to
                protected branches, there was really nothing stopping anyone
                from merging those changes without oversight. Social conventions
                steered people toward asking someone to view your changes and
                leave comments, but these comments couldn’t keep folks from
                merging into master, regardless of the code quality.
            </p>

            <p>
                We could fix this with a first-class code review process. We
                wanted to do a few things:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Allow reviewers to explicitly approve, request changes, or
                    simply comment on pull requests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Batch up individual review comments into a single review
                    notification.
                </li>
                <li>Disallow merging based on reviews requesting changes.</li>
                <li>More easily facilitate code-based conversations.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                The first thing we needed to do was provide a user interface to
                actually leave the review. In pull requests we already had the
                ability to leave comments on individual lines of code. Doing so
                would send a notification to anyone participating in the pull
                request. This ended up being super noisy even in pull requests
                with few changes.
            </p>

            <p>
                We wanted to add on top of this informal process by adding an
                explicit approval. We also needed the ability to request changes
                on specific lines of code. Further, people could add an
                additional overall comment. We first needed a place to do this.
                My original approach was to put a new form at the bottom of the
                “Files changed” tab. Conceptually, this seemed to make sense,
                since users would read from top to bottom, and then leave their
                overall review at the end.
            </p>

            <figure
                class="w-screen relative left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 max-w-none"
            >
                <img
                    src="media/code-review-footer.png"
                    alt="Code review footer"
                    width="803"
                    loading="lazy"
                    class="mx-auto"
                />
            </figure>

            <p>
                In practice, this proved to be a little cumbersome. Not
                everyone’s code review process is that linear. After building an
                early version, we found that users often write a few comments,
                move onto another task, and then return to the pull request
                later. The review footer was often missed or ignored entirely,
                especially if the diff was a long one.
            </p>

            <p>
                Instead, we moved the act of signoff into a popover that lived
                in our already-sticky header. Instead of showing our approve,
                request changes, or commenting options in a drop down combo box,
                we’d make it a permanent fixture. This made code review more
                discoverable, and allowed us to more easily disable those
                options if needed depending on the user’s permission level.
            </p>

            <figure
                class="w-screen relative left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 max-w-none"

                    class="mx-auto"
                />
            </figure>

            <p>
                To cut down on the noise that commenting on a line of code made,
                we decided not to submit comment immediately. Instead, we’d
                batch these up into a pending state before submitting them
                together with the entire review. This proved to be slightly
                tricky, since we’d be changing behavior slightly. We’d need to
                show that comments were in a pending state.
            </p>

            <figure
                class="w-screen relative left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 max-w-none"
            >

                />
            </figure>

            <p>
                Since users were now submitting entire review objects with 3
                potential states, and an arbitrary number of comments, we needed
                a way to thread them into the conversation view. I originally
                took an aggressive approach, only showing the comments and the
                line numbers where they occurred. It was an interesting goal,
                but it ended up reducing the overall readability of a
                conversation. There was just too much clicking required to tell
                what the hell was going on.
            </p>

            <p>
                Instead, we needed to show more context for where the
                conversation was taking place. We also needed a way to quickly
                reply right inline with comments. In internally-shipped versions
                of code review, the only way to reply to a review was to then
                leave your own review. This was super cumbersome. We’d always
                had a version of replying to line comments, but their
                positioning was only inferred. With code review, we also built a
                first-class version of replies that follow the original comment
                around, regardless of context.

                The final piece in code review was allowing or disallowing
                merging based on the status of review. For the default, it was
                decided that in order for a pull request to merge, it would
                require at least one approved review and no reviews requesting
                changes. In terms of our user interface, this would require
                another section in our merge area. There were a ton of
                permutations in this section already, since pull requests may
                already require statuses on top of reviews. This needed to be
                accounted for in the design exploration.

                Since we were making pretty substantial workflow changes, we
                needed a way to announce them. GitHub has a nice history of
                blogging and making announcements, but often our users miss
                these. I proposed an interstitial that folks could dismiss once
                they understood the changes. This included a large banner
                explaining what code review is, as well as smaller tutorial
                popovers explaining that comments were now batched.

                <a href="https://github.com/fabianperez">@fabianperez</a>. It
                seemed the feature touched just about every single part of the
                GitHub codebase. It’s no small miracle that the feature worked
                as well as it did. The effort the team put in to make sure it
                shipped was nothing short of amazing.

                Working on GitHub was an amazing experience. It was my first
                foray in using
                <a

                live changes to a massive userbase. Since GitHub uses GitHub to
                build GitHub, it’s exciting (and sometimes frustrating) to be
                fully immersed in the product you’re building. Helping build
                even the smallest feature at such a massive scale was often
                nerve-wracking, but fulfilling.

                This post serves as a greatest-hits, so to speak, of my time at
                GitHub. Countless tiny refinements are made by each of GitHub’s
                talented designers and engineers every day. This post also only
                highlights actual directions that were explored. As an example,
                a feature like Code Review often results in a Sketch file with a
                ton of revisions and exploration. It can also spawn a number of
                prototypes that are simply too ephemeral to capture here. This
                is an account of what actually shipped. ✌️
